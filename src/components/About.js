                    Founded by four like-minded people with lived-experience of
                    Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), mental health and

                    Kids - Creative Counselling and Play Therapy is a
                    not-for-profit therapeutic service which children, young
                    people, families and the professionals who support them, use

                    Above all you want your child, young person and yourself to
                    be and feel safe, valued and listened to when using any app.

                <p>
                    You told us that there are worrying and sometimes dangerous
                    links on other sites. You said you don't want inappropriate
                    adverts. You want to know the price and cost upfront - and
                    not have to pay extra suddenly, to get the full program. You
                    wanted to be able to adapt the app to make it personalised
                    for you and your child, young person or family's needs.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We use a few carefully selected links. But importantly,
                    these have been checked to be appropriate and stop at that
                    page. This means your child or young person can't link out
                    of this app. We also have some links that a only for parents
                    and carers, teachers and other professionals. Only adults
                    with an account can access these. You can choose to allow
                    these to be accessed by your child or young person by
                    toggling the buttons on the parent and carer dashboard.

                    You can toggle the features on the site map so they better
                    fit you, your child or young person, or your family's needs.

                    https://www.sensoryapphouse.com have kindly allowed us to

                    us. Their apps are great, and are safe to use because they
                    don't have any adverts, pop-ups, or dangerous lnks away from
                    their site.

                <p>
                    How does this help? Dr. Craig Richard is a scientist at
                    Shenandoah University in Virginia, and an ASMR expert. He
                    says that ASMR can help you to have a deep relaxed feeling
                    often with light and enjoyable brain tingles. In scientific
                    tests, ASMR shows that different areas of the brain are
                    active when someone is experiencing ASMR. The scientists
                    think that these parts of the brain are using more dopamine
                    and oxytocin hormones. These hormones can make some people
                    feel calmer, less anxious and less worried. Another reason
                    may be because you concentrate as you are listening to ASMR.
                    You also breathe in and out more slowly and at the same
                    rhythm and beat, so they help to regulate your breathing.
                    Different ASMR sounds and experiences work for different
                    people, so find the one that is best for you.

                <h3>Essential oils and aromatherapy in playdoh and orbeex</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2019, a study called Aromatherapy and Essential Oils: A
                    Map of the Evidence looked at all of the research on
                    Essential Oils and Aromatherapy and found that they can be
                    helpful.

                    Your sense of smell (olfactory sense) is very powerful.
                    Sensory scents (smells) are carried in your blood stream.
                    They travel up your nose fast and act as a warning system to
                    keep you safe by going directly to your brain (and not
                    around your body first). They go to the hippocampus and
                    amygdala. These two areas in your brain that store memories
                    and emotions. This means scents miss the frontal cortex.
                    This is the part of your brain where you think - and may
                    have anxious or worrying thoughts. It also means that a
                    scent misses the parts of your body where you're feeling
                    anxiety. Instead, it can quickly start to work right in the
                    hippocampus and the amygdala and help you to begin to feel
                    calmer and more relaxed.

                    Scientists have found that we have many visual and emotional
                    associations to certain smells and aromas. Many calming
                    smells like vanilla also remind you of when you were a baby.
                    The right smells for you can help you feel safe and secure.
                    Feeling calm helps your body to breathe more slowly and
                    deeply and helps your heartbeat to feel more regular, too.
                    This is called regulating your breathing.{' '}

                    sounds are muffled. You can hear a heart, beating. This
